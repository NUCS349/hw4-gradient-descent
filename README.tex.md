# HW7: Gradient Descent for EECS 349 @ NU
**IMPORTANT: PUT YOUR NETID IN THE FILE** `netid` in the root directory of the assignment.
This is used to put the autograder output into Canvas. Please don't put someone else's netid
here, we will check.


In this assignment, you will:
- Implement binary and multiclass gradient descent
- Implement and explore the effect of regularization on gradient descent learning
- Visualize the loss landscape traversed by gradient descent

## Clone this repository

To clone this repository run the following command:
